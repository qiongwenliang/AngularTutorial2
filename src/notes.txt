(!!!very important interview question) Communication between components:  -> input and output properties

1. Send data from parent to child, when two components are relative to each other, we need to use:
    -- to send data from parent to child we need to use input property/decorator(must use input decorator)

2. Send data from child to parent
    -- we need to use output decorator/event
        --- if child is emiiting an event then the parent component must have an event handler
